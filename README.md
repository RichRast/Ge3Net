# Ge3Net

Experiments were run on three genotypes - humans, dogs and ancient and for geography, unsupervised space constructed from pca and umap. Additionally, we ran experiment with ukb snps with pca constructed space.
1. Build labels by running the script buildLabels.py
2. For training, run trainer.py
3. For inference only with a pre-trained model, run inference.py
